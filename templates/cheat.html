<h2>Trying to cheat the Sphinx, eh?</h2>
<p>You've got guts, I'll give you that. The last person who tried got eaten! I think they gave it indigestion though
  because it's been a bit wary of eating humans since.</p>
<p>You'll have to <a href="{{url_for('sign_in')}}">sign in again</a> if you want to try playing again honestly.</p>
<p>Be warned though, the Sphinx might not be so forgiving next time!</p>
