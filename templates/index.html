<h2>Meet The Sphinx!</h2>
<p>
  A sphinx is a mythical creature
  with the head of a human and the body of a lion.
</p>
<p>
  In Greek tradition, it has the head of a human, the haunches of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a bird. It is
  mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its riddle suffer a fate typical in such
  mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster. This deadly version of a sphinx appears
  in the myth and drama of Oedipus.
</p>
<p>Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man. In addition, the
  Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and
  both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.
</p>
<p>
  Our sphinx has long lost its appetite for human flesh, but still delights in asking riddles, as difficult as it can think of. </p>
  <p>
